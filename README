# Fraud Detection using Machine Learning

## Overview
This project builds a machine learning–based fraud detection system for financial transactions. The goal is to identify fraudulent transactions from highly imbalanced data while minimizing false negatives.

## Dataset
- Financial transaction dataset with over 6 million records
- Features include transaction type, amount, account balances, and timestamps
- Due to computational constraints, a representative subset of 1 million records was used

## Approach
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Handling class imbalance
- Feature selection and multicollinearity analysis
- Logistic Regression (baseline model)
- Random Forest (performance-oriented model)

## Evaluation Metrics
- Precision
- Recall
- F1-Score
- ROC-AUC
- Confusion Matrix

## Key Insights
- Fraudulent transactions typically involve large amounts
- Transfers followed by cash-outs are high-risk patterns
- Sudden balance depletion is a strong fraud indicator

## Tools & Technologies
Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn

## Business Impact
The model insights can help financial institutions implement real-time fraud prevention strategies and reduce financial losses.

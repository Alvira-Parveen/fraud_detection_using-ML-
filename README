## 💳 Fraud Detection using Machine Learning

An **end-to-end machine learning project** that detects **fraudulent financial transactions** from large-scale transaction data.
The system focuses on **highly imbalanced classification**, model interpretability, and deriving **actionable business insights** for real-world fraud prevention.

---

## 📌 Problem Statement

Financial fraud poses significant risks to companies and customers.
Fraudulent transactions are rare, evolve over time, and often involve complex patterns such as rapid fund transfers and account draining.

Traditional rule-based systems struggle to adapt to such patterns, leading to :

- High false negatives (missed fraud)
- Increased financial losses
- Poor customer experience

The objective of this project is to build a **data-driven fraud detection system** that accurately identifies fraudulent transactions while minimizing missed fraud cases.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project implements **a machine learning–based fraud detection pipeline** using historical transaction data.

The workflow includes :

- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Handling severe class imbalance
- Feature selection and multicollinearity analysis
- Training and evaluating multiple ML models
- Interpreting results to propose business-level prevention strategies

Both statistical rigor and business judgment are emphasized.

## 🎯 Project Objectives

- Detect fraudulent transactions from highly imbalanced data
- Build interpretable and performance-driven ML models
- Identify key behavioral patterns indicative of fraud
- Evaluate models using appropriate metrics beyond accuracy
- Propose actionable fraud prevention strategies

## 📊 Dataset Description

**Dataset Source**

The dataset represents **simulated real-world financial transactions** over a period of 30 days, containing more than **6.3 million records**.

Features :-
Each transaction includes - Time step (hourly granularity)
                          - Transaction type (PAYMENT, TRANSFER, CASH_OUT, etc.)
                          - Transaction amount
                          - Account balances before and after the transaction
                          - Fraud labels (isFraud, isFlaggedFraud)

**Dataset Subset Used**

Due to local hardware constraints, **a representative subset of 1 million transactions** was used for model development.

This subset : Preserves class imbalance
              Maintains transaction behavior patterns
              Enables efficient training on CPU-based systems

The methodology is scalable to the full dataset.

## 🧹 Data Preprocessing & Cleaning

Key preprocessing steps included :

1. Missing Values
        - No significant missing values observed
        - Merchant-related balance gaps treated as expected behavior

2. Outlier Analysis

         - Transaction amounts were highly right-skewed
         - Outliers were retained, as extreme values are meaningful fraud signals

3. Categorical Encoding

          - Transaction type encoded numerically

4. Feature Selection

          - Removed non-informative identifiers (nameOrig, nameDest)

          - Removed rule-based leakage feature (isFlaggedFraud)

5. Multicollinearity Analysis

          - Strong correlations observed between balance-related features

          - Addressed through feature selection and model choice

---

## 🤖 Models Used
**1️⃣ Logistic Regression**

- Used as a baseline model
- High interpretability
- Class imbalance handled using class_weight='balanced'

**2️⃣ Random Forest Classifier**

- Captures non-linear fraud patterns
- Robust to multicollinearity
- Provides feature importance for interpretability
- Better overall performance on fraud detection

---

## 📊 Model Evaluation

Given the severe class imbalance, accuracy alone was avoided.

**Metrics Used** : Precision
                   Recall (critical for fraud detection)
                   F1-Score
                   ROC-AUC
                   Confusion Matrix

These metrics provide a realistic assessment of fraud detection performance.

---

## 🔑 Key Fraud Indicators Identified

The most influential predictors of fraud included :

- Large transaction amounts
- High-risk transaction types (TRANSFER, CASH_OUT)
- Sudden depletion of origin account balance
- Unusual increase in destination account balance

These patterns closely align with real-world fraud behavior.

---

## 🛡️ Business Insights & Prevention Strategy

Based on model insights, the following prevention measures are recommended :

- Real-time monitoring of high-value transactions
- Velocity checks for rapid balance depletion
- Step-up authentication for suspicious transfers
- Periodic retraining to handle fraud pattern drift

---

## 📈 Measuring Effectiveness

The success of deployed fraud prevention measures can be evaluated through :

- Reduction in fraud-related financial losses
- Improvement in recall and ROC-AUC scores
- Monitoring false positive rates
- Continuous performance tracking and drift detection

# 💳 Fraud Detection using Machine Learning

An **end-to-end machine learning project** for detecting **fraudulent financial transactions** from large-scale, highly imbalanced data.  
The system emphasizes **model interpretability**, **robust evaluation**, and **actionable business insights** for real-world fraud prevention.

---

## 📌 Problem Statement

Financial fraud poses significant risks to companies and customers.  
Fraudulent transactions are **rare**, evolve over time, and often involve complex patterns such as:

- Rapid fund transfers  
- Account draining  
- Large abnormal transaction amounts  

Traditional rule-based systems struggle to adapt, resulting in:
- ❌ Missed fraud cases (false negatives)  
- ❌ Increased financial losses  
- ❌ Poor customer experience  

**Goal:** Build a **data-driven fraud detection system** that accurately identifies fraudulent transactions while minimizing missed fraud cases.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project implements a **machine learning–based fraud detection pipeline** using historical transaction data.

### Workflow:
- Data cleaning & preprocessing  
- Handling severe class imbalance  
- Feature selection & multicollinearity analysis  
- Model training & evaluation  
- Business insight extraction  

Both **statistical rigor** and **business reasoning** are emphasized.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Detect fraud from highly imbalanced transaction data  
- Build interpretable and performance-driven ML models  
- Identify key behavioral fraud patterns  
- Evaluate models using appropriate metrics (beyond accuracy)  
- Propose actionable fraud prevention strategies  

---

## 📊 Dataset

- Simulated real-world financial transactions  
- **6.3M+ records**, 30 days of activity  
- Hourly time granularity  
- Includes transaction type, amount, balances, and fraud labels  

### ⚠️ Dataset Usage Note
Due to hardware constraints, a **representative subset of 1M transactions** was used.  
The approach is **fully scalable** to the complete dataset.

---

## 🧹 Data Preprocessing

Key steps performed:

- ✅ Missing value analysis (no critical missing values)  
- ✅ Outlier analysis (retained due to fraud relevance)  
- ✅ Categorical encoding (`type`)  
- ✅ Removed non-informative identifiers  
- ✅ Prevented data leakage (`isFlaggedFraud` removed)  
- ✅ Multicollinearity analysis on balance features  

---

## 🤖 Models Implemented

### 1️⃣ Logistic Regression
- Baseline & interpretable model  
- Class imbalance handled using `class_weight='balanced'`  

### 2️⃣ Random Forest
- Captures non-linear fraud patterns  
- Robust to multicollinearity  
- Provides feature importance for insights  

---

## 📈 Model Evaluation

Accuracy alone is misleading for fraud detection.

### Metrics Used:
- Precision  
- Recall (critical for fraud detection)  
- F1-Score  
- ROC-AUC  
- Confusion Matrix  

These metrics provide a realistic assessment of performance.

---

## 🔑 Key Fraud Indicators

The most influential fraud predictors identified:

- Large transaction amounts  
- High-risk transaction types (TRANSFER, CASH_OUT)  
- Sudden depletion of origin account balance  
- Unusual increase in destination account balance  

These patterns align strongly with real-world fraud behavior.

---

## 🛡️ Business Insights & Prevention

### Recommended Actions:
- Real-time monitoring of high-value transactions  
- Velocity checks for rapid balance depletion  
- Step-up authentication for suspicious transfers  
- Periodic model retraining to handle fraud drift
